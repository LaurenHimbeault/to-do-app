# Todo App ‚Äî Student Starter

Welcome! This project is a **full-stack Todo app** built for learning purposes.  
It‚Äôs designed so you can run everything **locally** with Docker, explore the code,  
and (optionally) try deploying it with cloud services.

---

## Quick Start (local with Docker)

Clone the repo and start all services in one command:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> to-do-app
cd to-do-app
docker compose up --build
````

* Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
* API health: [http://localhost:8080/health](http://localhost:8080/health)
* API routes: [http://localhost:8080/\_\_routes](http://localhost:8080/__routes)

Stop with `Ctrl+C` and clean up with:

```bash
docker compose down
```
